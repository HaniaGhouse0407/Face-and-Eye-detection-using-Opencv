# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face and eye detection from images or webcam video feed. It uses Haar cascades, a machine learning-based approach, to detect faces and eyes.

## Features

- Detect faces and eyes in images or real-time video feed
- Display rectangles around detected faces and eyes
- Can handle multiple faces and eyes simultaneously

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-eye-detection.git
